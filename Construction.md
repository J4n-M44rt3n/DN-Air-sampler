# Assembly of the DNAir sampler
## Tools and parts
The picture below gives you an overview of the tools and parts you'll need to build the DNAir sampler for collecting environmental DNA. Printable 3D files are in the [3D-files folder](./3D-files). Additionally, you'll need two plastic 6804 ball bearings and three 0.3 mm 8x10 cm polysterene blades per sampler. Not pictured but good to have around are a ruler and powdered graphite with a brush, for lubrication.

## Steps

### 01
Glue the ball bearings into the printed blade holders. For better bonding, roughen the contact surfaces first. I used cyanoacrylate 'super' glue. Time will tell if this is the best glue to weather the elements. The ball bearings have a top side (only outer and inner ring show) and a bottom side (placeholder balls also shows). Glue the ball bearings such that the top sides face outward.

### 02
Glue the 'closing screw bottom' to the ball bearing of the bottom blade holder. Again, roughen the contact surfaces first. I find it hard to apply the exact right amount of glue, so I overdo it and then use a q-tip to soak up the excess glue. The q-tip has a nasty chemical reaction to the ca glue (gets all hot, bad fumes) so be careful! I always wear a mask and gloves. A trick to align the bottom screw part properly is to screw in the core part to the bottom part, and then push the core plus screw through the central hole in the ball bearing until the contact surfaces meet. It sets quickly and you can easily unscrew the cre part again.
